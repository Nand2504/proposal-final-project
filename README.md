# Proposal

the title of my project(as of right now) will most likely be "ball slasher" or something of the sorts

my project is a 2d game where balls will drop down, at first being 1 then 2 then 3 etc... and as tiem goes on the amount of balls will increase and the player has to move their cursor to try and slash/get rid of the balls as fast as possible

my project is a game type project that I plan on creating in unity. my software will create a game similar to fruit ninja where a player will be bombarded with balls that they have to try and get rid of(haven't decided how yet). If I am able to I plan on inlcuding a feature that will allow the player to choose between different difficulties at the start. Right now I haven't figured out how it will be executed

A good outcome for my project will be being able to create the basis of the game without anything extra, so the game would start and the balls would start dropping and the player would be able to start getting rid of them like it's designed.

The best outcome for my project would be being able to incorporate different difficulty modes, as well as a penality if to many balls aren't slashed in the amount of time or a reward if the player does a good job. 

my next steps would be downloading unity and starting to learn how to use it and see how it differs from the coding sites I've used. Then searching up different tutorials and getting the hang of how to use unity and learning the skills needed to create the game.
